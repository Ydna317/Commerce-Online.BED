# Commerce-Online

Commerce-Online is an application that helps businesses with keeping track of their data and products. The application can be used to store inventory and keep track of items via their category, product, or tag. The application will allow you to create new CPTs(Categories, Products, & Tags), update ones you already have, or delete ones you no longer need. The application is designed to be easily manipulated by authorized personnel and can be saved as a database to send off to whoever is in the know.

## Installation

Install the necessary packages by typing 'npm install' into the command line.

```bash
npm install

Run seeded information to get the application going and see how it will work via Postman or Insomnia.
